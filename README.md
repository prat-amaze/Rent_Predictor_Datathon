## Introduction

In the real estate industry, accurate rent predictions play a crucial role in assisting property owners, tenants, and property management companies in making informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the rental price of residential properties using a dataset containing historical rental information and property attributes.

## Problem Statement

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. The model is trained on the provided training dataset, `House_rent_train.csv`. The resulting model is saved as `rent_predictor.pkl` for future use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (for running `Pravartak_Datathon.ipynb`)
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rental-price-prediction.git

### Usage

To use the trained rental price prediction model:

Run the Jupyter Notebook Pravartak_Datathon.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.

The trained model will be saved as rent_predictor.pkl.


### Model Training

The process of training the rental price prediction model is documented in the Jupyter Notebook Pravartak_Datathon.ipynb. The notebook covers the following steps:

- Data loading and exploration
- Feature preprocessing and engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics


### Model Deployment

Currently, the model is trained and evaluated within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Future work could involve deploying the model as a web application or API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.

### Results

The results of the trained model, including performance metrics and predictions on the test dataset, are presented in the Jupyter Notebook Pravartak_Datathon.ipynb.
